@chapter Program overview

The data are loaded into the program from a file with stock quotes with the .csv extension.@*
The file contains data in the form of a table, where the first column is the date, @*
the second column is the value of the function@*

The user sets the number of points on which the graph should be plotted (the number of points is not less than in the loaded file)@*
All points are evenly distributed between the start and end dates@
Two interpolation methods are implemented: Cubic Spline and Newton's Polynomial of nth degree.@*
There is a button in the interface for drawing the cubic spline graph@*
There is a button in the interface for drawing the graph by the Newton polynomial of nth degree@*
There is a field in the interface for entering the degree of the Newton polynomial@*
There is a button in the interface for clearing the field to draw graphs (the field is cleared only when you click on this button or new data is uploaded)@*
There can be up to 5 graphs displayed in the field at the same time (all graphs have different color)@*
If there are already 5 graphs displayed in the field, the buttons for drawing new graphs is blocked@*
The interface has to contain the following information about the graphs:
Color
Name of the file from which the data were taken
Interpolation method (specifying the degree if it is a Newton polynomial)

Program is able to output the values of the stock quotes function obtained by both interpolation methods according to a user-defined argument value (date and time)
The program is developed in C++ language of C++17 standard.@*
Makefile targets: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, tests.@*
GUI implemented basing on Qt 6.@*

@section Create a maze
To create a maze, you should specify its height and width using spinboxes. Maximum size is 50x50.
Then press "Build" button to view the maze.
Maze is generated using @url{https://prog.world/maze-generation-ellers-algorithm/,,Eller's algorithm}, 
which creates 'perfect' mazes, having only a single path between any two cells, one row at a time.

@node Save to disk,Find a route,Create a maze,Mazes
@section Save to disk
Once created, the maze may be stored in the format described above. To do that press "Save" button.

@node Find a route,,Save to disk,Mazes
@section Find a route
To find the shortest route from any point within maze to another, simply click on the starting point, 
then on the destination. The program finds the route and shows it step-by-step, along with indicating
the number of steps.

@node Caves description,Cave Generation,Caves
@section Caves description
A cave that has passed 0 simulation steps (only initialized) can be stored in the file as a number 
of rows and columns, as well as a matrix containing the positions of "live" and "dead" cells.
@format
An example of such a file:
4 4
0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 1
@end format

@node Cave Generation, ,Caves description,
@section Cave Generation
The caves are being generated using the cellular automaton. 
This kind of generation uses an idea similar to the Game of Life. @*
The idea of the algorithm consists of implementing only two steps: 
first, the whole field is filled randomly with walls - i.e., for each cell 
it is randomly determined whether it will be free or impassable - 
and then the map state is updated several times according to the conditions, 
similar to the birth/death ones in the Game of Life. @*
The rules are simpler than in the Game of Life - 
there are two special variables, one for "birth" of "dead" cells (the "birth" limit) 
and one for destruction of "live" cells (the "death" limit).
If "live" cells are surrounded by "live" cells, the number of which is less than the "death" limit, 
they "die". In the same way, if "dead" cells are next to "live" cells, the number of which is greater 
than the "birth" limit, they become "live".@*
